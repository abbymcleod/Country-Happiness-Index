    "Our research question is: Is there a correlation between a country's percent urban population and their happiness level index measured by the World Happiness index? The World Happiness Index describes the process of creating this value as the following: “it asks respondents to think of a ladder, with the best possible life for them being a 10 and the worst possible life being a 0. They are then asked to rate their own current lives on that 0 to 10 scale.” Could a country's GDP have an effect on happiness index since higher GDP can correlate to better living conditions and life styles? Could certain types of government lead to happier citizens? Does quality of life in urban areas differ from country to country, and if so, how does this correlate to happiness index?"

    "Urbanization, or the percent of urban population, refers to how much of a country's population lives in an urban (city) area. We are using this as a measure of how urbanized a country is. A country's happiness level index is a 1 to 10 scale which measures how \"happy\" a country is, taking into account factors like life satisfaction, psychological well-being, health, community, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "The World Happiness Report has been used as a measure of determining the world's happiest countries by analzing six particular categories: gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, social support, healthy life expectancy, freedom to make life choices, generosity of the general population, and perceptions of internal and external corruption levels.<a name=\\\"cite_ref-1\\\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1) In recent years, researchers have investigated how urbanization, GDP, government types, and life expectancy correlate with happiness levels. Findings are still varied, however, with some studies showing positive correlations and others suggesting a complex lack of correlation. Findings from the report indicate that indeed, in many countries, happiness levels are higher in urban areas, but this trend is nuanced. For example, a comparison in the level of happiness between urban and rural populations in poorer regions, such as Sub-Saharan Africa, indicates higher levels of happiness among urban dwellers due to increased job opportunities and more service and infrastructural provisions, while some Western countries tend to show higher well-being indicators in rural areas due to less stress and closer communal bonding.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea of how a country's GDP can affect things such as quality of living has been researched extensively. More specific to our question is the idea of how living in urban, rurual, or suburban areas can affect someone's happiness. There has been much research around this already, pointing to the idea that people are more happy living in suburban \"sweet spots\" than they living in rural or urban areas<a name=\\\"cite_ref-2\\\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2). We are researching an intersection between these: rather than researching a country's GDP or something similar and comparing it to their happiness index score, we are researching how the urbanization of a country can correlate to the happiness index score of that country. Do more urbanized countries tend to be happier? If individuals are happier living in suburban areas, does that mean that moderately urbanized countries will be happiest?\n",
    "\n",
    "In a study in 2020 conducted by the European Commission and Gallup analyzed the degree of urbanization's effect on happiness. This study asked 360,000 people across cities, towns, semi-dense areas, and rural areas of 117 countries to rate their lives on a scale from 0 to 10. The study found that on average, the percent of people in any country who gave their lives a score between 8 and 10 is 2-4% higher in cities than rural areas. The study recognizes that a variety of other factors could have contributed to this difference in happiness level between cities and rural areas. One of these factors they measured was access to financial resources. Differences in access to financial resources are most pronounced in low-income economies as the study found that 18% of rural residents reported having a bank account, while 30% of city residents reported having a bank account. Additionally, the study found that rural residents in lower-income economies were more likely than city residents to lack having enough money to buy food. Finally, the study measured support from frineds or relatives to help them in times of need. On average, the rural residents were less likely to report having support in times of need than city dwellers.<a name=\\\"cite_ref-3\\\"></a>[<sup>3</sup>](#cite_note-3) Overall, this study depicts how complex the idea of measuring happiness is as it cannot be narrowed down to a singular factor like degree of urbanization.\n",
    "\n",
    "One key factor in the changing of happiness levels is the amount of greenery sustained during the changing from rural environments to urban environments. As urban population increases, access to green spaces and quality of ecosystems decrease, making this a topic of concern among urban planners. Jorge E. Patino studied one of the most urbanized regions in the world, Latin America and the Caribbean, where his discovered a positive correlation between access to urban green spaces and happiness levels in urban areas <a name=\\\"cite_ref-4\\\"></a>[<sup>4</sup>](#cite_note-4). There are however several other factors that need to be considered when studying the effects of urban green spaces and happiness levels. Patino also notes that in some cities, those with higher socioeconomic status access to better quality urban green spaces, which suggests that socioeconomic status could be a confounding variable that must be studied further. Additionally, he found that reports of happiness tended to be higher the older the respondant was. We want to discover exactly what factors, such as access to green spaces, are effected by urbanization, and how these factors contribute to happiness levels in urban populations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, while degree of urbanization may be a significant factor in determining the happiness level of people in a certain country, there are a variety of variables that contribute to determining the level of happiness for a population. Prior research suggests that happiness is a complex concept to measure, and variables such as GDP, government type, average life expectancy etc. can each play a role in the complexity of determining the happiness level for a country. Despite the amount of research done on this topic, determining if there is the correlation between a country's percent of urban population and their happiness level still remains to be answered. Furthermore, understanding the relationship that the aforementioned variables have with happiness level is an important aspect of this research topic to explore.\n",

    "We believe that there is a positive correlation between percent urbanization population of country and country hapiness index. The reasoning behind this is that urban areas usually offer better job opportunities, health care, education, and social amenities; therefore, more comfort in life. Higher urbanization could spur economic growth because a large population is often tied to increased productivity, innovation, and consumer demand in the ways described above that boost GDP. Moreover, we hypothesize that factors like higher GDP per capita, democratic goverments, and higher average life expectancy will be positively correlated with happiness levels, as these variables typically allow for improved living conditions, robust social services, greater life quality, and increased personal stability."

    "  - Link to the dataset: https://worldhappiness.report/data/\n",
    "  - Number of observations: 10\n",
    "  - Number of variables: 143\n",
    "  - This dataset contains data on 143 countries that describes the happiness level of each country along with the factors contributing to this level of happiness. The ladder score is the average of the past three years of survey, and the whiskers of the ladder score are also included. The other observations are numbers that each make up a percentage of the ladder score, with the observations being: GDP per capita, social support, healthy life expectancy, freedom, generosity, and perceptions of corruption. One thing that may be required in processing the data set would be turning the values of the observations that make up the ladder score into proportions to compare the effects each factor has on the ladder score.\n",

    "  - Number of variables: 4\n",
    "  - This dataset has three important columns: country, year from 1999 - 2022, and percent of urban population living in slums. It shows the percent of urban population who live in slums where “A slum household is defined as a group of individuals living under the same roof lacking one or more of the following conditions: access to improved water, access to improved sanitation, sufficient living area, durability of housing, and security of tenure.”. This can be wrangled by adding a column with the percent living in slums to a dataframe that contains the urban population percent. This can add insight on a confounding variable where high urban population percent and low happiness index of country may be due to a high urban population slum percent.  \n",

It also includes observations for groups of countries based on size,  income level, conflict level, debt, and geography. Each column is a year and contains the percent change in urban population as a float. We can compare this data with the countries’ change in happiness for each of these years to see if there is a correlation between the urban growth and happiness levels. \n",

This dataset will be useful because we can use it to see the percent of urban population in each country per year. To wrangle this data, we can remove any observations with missing data, and we can also remove the country code, which tells us the same thing as the country name.

The important variables in this dataset are 2024, which provides the GDP per capita for each observation in the year 2024, and 2023, which provides the GDP per capita for each observation in the year 2023. These metrics serve as proxies for factors such as a country's economic development and quality of life. To preprocess the dataset, we can remove the variables between 1980 and 2022 inclusive and between 2025 and 2029 inclusive because these years are not relevant, and we can remove region and analytical group observations, as we are focusing on data by country. Additionally, for observations with missing values for the variable 2024, we can fill in this value with the value for the variable 2023, or we can remove any observations with missing values for both 2023 and 2024.\n",

    "We need to address the fact that if there is a positive correlation this is not causation. Making more urban areas or moving to an urban area does not mean you/your citizens will be happier. In considering the ethical and privacy-related aspects of our analysis, we believe that the data we used is unbiased and respects privacy. Our primary sources include the World Happiness Report, World Bank, etc., which are reputable and widely-cited resources that offer open access to data. Additionally, all data is collected at the national or regional level, ensuring that privacy of individuals is protected as no personal data is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, measuring complex variables like happiness is a difficult task as reports like The World Happiness Report relies on subjective survey responses and includes a limited range of factors that may not capture the full depth of variables contributing to happiness. This could lead to biases or misreports on how happiness is rated. Similarly, measurements like GDP per capita and life expectancy may depict values that do not account for the true well-being of people in a certain society, region, or environment. Additionally, variables like government type may not fully capture the difference of political systems in different countries as some forms of government may not fit into a specified category. We recognize that these measures may not fully address the complexities of variables we measure in this research project.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite these limitations and constraints, we chose datasets that are widely-used and accepted. We are aware that research may not provide a definitive method of measuring the correlation between a country's percent of urban population and its happiness levels. While we aim to explore the potential relationship between these variables, we recognize that happiness and well-being is complex and can be influenced by a wide range of variables. Therefore, we explore a variety of additional variables and their relationship to happiness levels in addition to a country's urban population percentage. Our findings should be interpreted as an initial exploration rather than a comprehensive and definitive measure of happiness.\n"
