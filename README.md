This project analyzes the relationship between urban population metrics and national happiness scores using data-driven methods. It explores how factors such as urbanization, environmental characteristics, and economic indicators correlate with happiness levels across different countries.

This project was developed along with four other groupmates for COGS 108 (Data Scinece in Practice) at UCSD. This repository contains all of the project materials and checkpoints that were included in the original project repository. The completed project can be found under the file *FinalProject_Group010-FA24.ipynb*.
