    "In our analysis, we are using the World Happiness Report to define a country's level of happiness. This metric is measured through a random sample of 1,000 people from a designated country per year, and then averaged out over the past three years of measurements (1). Using the Cantril Ladder, participants in the survey are asked to imagine their life as a ladder and rank how good their life is on a scale of 0 - 10, 10 being the absolute best life imaginable and 0 being the worst (1).\n",
    "\n",
    "The World Happiness Report also attributes 6 factors to each country's happiness score, each factor contributing a different amount to the total happiness of the country. The 6 factors are levels of GDP, life expectancy, generosity, social support, freedom, and corruption (1). As such, this data can be used to establish correlations between different factors that affect happiness. However, in our project we would also like to analyze the effects of urbanization on happiness levels and see if any of these factors play a part in this correlation.\n",

The surveyed population has to be representative of the country's population so certain survey methods may cause issues if they aren't accessible to those of lower socioecomic standing, which would result in an inflated Happiness Index.
