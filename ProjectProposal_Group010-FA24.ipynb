    "Our research question is: Is there a correlation between a country's percent urban population and their happiness level index measured by the World Happiness index? Could factors such as a country's GDP, types of government, and average life expectany, etc. correlate to its happiness levels? Is the happiness level of a country accurately measured by the World Happiness Index?"

    "Urbanization, or the percent urban population, as we are researching, refers to how much of a country's population lives in an urban (city) area. We are using this as a measure of how urbanized a country is. A country's happiness level index is a 1 to 10 scale which measures how \"happy\" a country is, taking into account factors like life satisfaction, psychological well-being, health, community, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea of how a country's GDP can affect things such as quality of living has been researched extensively. More specific to our question is the idea of how living in urban, rurual, or suburban areas can affect someone's happiness. There has been much research around this already, pointing to the idea that people are more happy living in suburban \"sweet spots\" than they living in rural or urban areas<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1). We are researching an intersection between these: rather than researching a country's GDP or something similar and comparing it to their happiness index score, we are researching how the urbanization of a country can correlate to the happiness index score of that country: do  more urbanized countries tend to be happier? Will it be similar to on an individual scale: if individuals are happier living in suburban areas, does that mean that moderately urbanized countries will be happiest? \n",
    "\n",
    "The World Happiness Report has been used a measure of determining the world's happiest countries by analzing six particular categories: gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, social support, healthy life expectancy, freedom to make life choices, generosity of the general population, and perceptions of internal and external corruption levels.<a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2) In recent years, researchers have investigated how urbanization, GDP, government types, and life expectancy correlate with happiness levels. Findings are still varied, however, with some studies showing positive correlations and others suggesting a complex lack of correlation. Findings from the report indicate that indeed, in many countries, happiness levels are higher in urban areas, but this trend is nuanced. For example, a comparison in the level of happiness between urban and rural populations in poorer regions, such as Sub-Saharan Africa, indicates higher levels of happiness among urban dwellers due to increased job opportunities and more service and infrastructural provisions, while some Western countries tend to show higher well-being indicators in rural areas due to less stress and closer communal bonding.\n",
    "\n",
    "In another study in 2020 conducted by the *European Commission* and *Gallup* analyzed the degree of urbanization's effect on happiness. This study asked 360,000 people across cities, towns, semi-dense areas, and rural areas of 117 countries to rate their lives on a scale from 0 to 10. The study found that on average, the percent of people in any country who gave their lives a score between 8 and 10 is 2-4% higher in cities than rural areas. The study recognizes that a variety of other factors could have contributed to this difference in happiness level between cities and rural areas. One of these factors they measured was access to financial resources. Differences in access to financial resources are most pronounced in low-income economies as the study found that 18% of rural residents reported having a bank account, while 30% of city residents reported having a bank account. Additionally, the study found that rural residents in lower-income economies were more likely than city residents to lack having enough money to buy food. Finally, the study measured support from frineds or relatives to help them in times of need. On average, the rural residents were less likely to report having support in times of need than city dwellers.<a name=\"cite_ref-3\"></a>[<sup>3</sup>](#cite_note-3) Overall, this study depicts how complex the idea of measuring happiness is as it cannot be narrowed down to a singular factor like degree of urbanization. \n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, while degree of urbanization may be a significant factor in determining the happiness level of people in a certain country, there are a variety of variables that contribute to determining the level of happiness for a population. Prior research suggests that happiness is a complex concept to measure, and variables such as GDP, government type, average life expectancy etc. can each play a role in the complexity of determining the happiness level for a country. Despite the amount of research done on this topic, determining if there is the correlation between a country's percent of urban population and their happiness level still remains to be answered. Furthermore, understanding the relationship that the aforementioned variables have with happiness level is an important aspect of this research topic to explore.\n",

  {

   "source": [
    "We believe that there is a positive correlation between percent urbanization population of country and country hapiness index. The reasoning behind this is that urban areas usually offer better job opportunities, health care, education, and social amenities; therefore, more comfort in life. Higher urbanization could spur economic growth because a large population is often tied to increased productivity, innovation, and consumer demand in the ways described above that boost GDP. We also expect that countries with a larger urban population might exhibit both higher GDP and, therefore, a combined increase in happiness levels due to the additive effects since GDP is positively related to happiness."

    "1. Ideally, the data would be based on a series of years regarding the percent urban population and the happiness index for each country. The variables to consider in the analyses would include the following.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Country-to identify each unique observation\n",
    "- Year-to observe time changes, seeing if changes in urbanization correlate with changes in happiness.\n",
    "- Urban Population Percentage-the total of a country's population living in urban areas within the yearly basis.\n",
    "- Happiness Index: A standardized happiness score/index for each country on a yearly basis.\n",
    "- GDP per Capita: Since economic development can be an intervening variable between urbanization and happiness.\n",
    "- Life Expectancy: To control for general health and standards of living that could affect the level of happiness.\n",
    "- Type of Government: Categorical for form of government, since governance affects both urbanization policies and well-being of the public.\n",
    "\n",
    "This would be a dataset that would, where possible, include annual data from at least the last 20 years to analyze the trends correctly. Such data will be obtained from the most reliable global surveys and databases such as the World Bank on urbanization and GDP, and the Gallup World Poll on happiness. It would be stored in a relational database structure, with Country and Year as unique keys, so each variable can - easily be queried and analyzed across time.\n",

    "2. Potential **real** datasets:\n",
    "-  **World Happiness Report**: https://worldhappiness.report/: This database contains annual happiness scores for most countries, reflecting survey data on several elements that may be related both to urbanization and to economic conditions. Although this report does not have any data on urbanization as such, it provides detailed data on happiness over time.\n",
    "- **World Bank Open Data**: https://data.worldbank.org: This is the dataset that provides data on the percentage of urban population, GDP per capita, and life expectancy for most countries. It best describes indicators matching these variables but may not actually include a direct happiness index.\n",
    "- United Nations Data: This provides data on urbanization and demographic data across time that could be used as a foundation to analyze the trends in population growth across urban areas. May not have direct measures of happiness and may need to link to the UN Data with happiness data from other sources."
