    "This is partly evident in the urbanization-happiness relationship whereby more of the population increasingly moves to urban areas. According to the *World Happiness Report 2020*, urban populations have expanded from 30% of the global population in 1950 to 55% by 2018, with projections suggesting this trend will continue towards 68% by 2050.<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1) This shift raises questions about the impacts of urbanization on well-being, particularly whether urban or rural residents report higher levels of happiness and which socio-economic factors might contribute to these differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Earlier work in the *World Happiness Report* explored the \"urban paradox,\" wherein cities in advanced countries-their economic and cultural attractions notwithstanding-record lower average happiness relative to countryside areas because of factors such as high living costs, pollution, and social isolation. <a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1)  Findings from the report indicate that indeed, in many countries, happiness levels are higher in urban areas, but this trend is nuanced. For example, a comparison in the level of happiness between urban and rural populations in poorer regions, such as Sub-Saharan Africa, indicates higher levels of happiness among urban dwellers due to increased job opportunities and more service and infrastructural provisions, while some Western countries tend to show higher well-being indicators in rural areas due to less stress and closer communal bonding. 3 basic\n",
    "\n",
    "Our research investigates the relationship between the urbanization rate of a country with its happiness index, among other measures such as GDP and life expectancy, in order to understand how different elements of urban living affect national happiness levels. By this, we hope to extend the work done by the *World Happiness Report* and look at how these relationships change with region and development level.\n",

  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "We believe that there is a positive correlation between percent urbanization population of country and country hapiness index. The reasoning behind this is that urban areas usually offer better job opportunities, health care, education, and social amenities; therefore, more comfort in life. Higher urbanization could spur economic growth because a large population is often tied to increased productivity, innovation, and consumer demand in the ways described above that boost GDP. We also expect that countries with a larger urban population might exhibit both higher GDP and, therefore, a combined increase in happiness levels due to the additive effects since GDP is positively related to happiness."

    "1. Ideally, the data would be based on a series of years regarding the percent urban population and the happiness index for each country. The variables to consider in the analyses would include the following.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Country-to identify each unique observation\n",
    "- Year-to observe time changes, seeing if changes in urbanization correlate with changes in happiness.\n",
    "- Urban Population Percentage-the total of a country's population living in urban areas within the yearly basis.\n",
    "- Happiness Index: A standardized happiness score/index for each country on a yearly basis.\n",
    "- GDP per Capita: Since economic development can be an intervening variable between urbanization and happiness.\n",
    "- Life Expectancy: To control for general health and standards of living that could affect the level of happiness.\n",
    "- Type of Government: Categorical for form of government, since governance affects both urbanization policies and well-being of the public.\n",
    "\n",
    "This would be a dataset that would, where possible, include annual data from at least the last 20 years to analyze the trends correctly. Such data will be obtained from the most reliable global surveys and databases such as the World Bank on urbanization and GDP, and the Gallup World Poll on happiness. It would be stored in a relational database structure, with Country and Year as unique keys, so each variable can - easily be queried and analyzed across time.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Potential **real** datasets:\n",
    "- World Happiness Report: This database contains annual happiness scores for most countries, reflecting survey data on several elements that may be related both to urbanization and to economic conditions. Although this report does not have any data on urbanization as such, it provides detailed data on happiness over time.\n",
    "- World Bank Open Data: This is the dataset that provides data on the percentage of urban population, GDP per capita, and life expectancy for most countries. It best describes indicators matching these variables but may not actually include a direct happiness index.\n",
    "- United Nations Data: This provides data on urbanization and demographic data across time that could be used as a foundation to analyze the trends in population growth across urban areas. May not have direct measures of happiness and may need to link to the UN Data with happiness data from other sources."
